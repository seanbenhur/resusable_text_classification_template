🔥A Resusable Template for Text Classification 🔥
</h1>

This is a complete resusable template for text classification powered with hydra, that lets you create State of the Art models without much effort.Currenlty this template supports transformer models and transformer architectures with different pooling strategies, you can use hydra to configure the arguments
  

<h2>🏅How this speeds up your development</h2>
I have been doing various text classification tasks for the past six months, working on different datasets, both personal and intern work, I find that most of the code that I write can be resused for many datasets, Though libraries like simple transformers exists, but I feel hard to configure those. Since I have been using these template for my projects, I belive this will help you also to create robust models with ease of workflow :)

This serves as a template to quickly have these things setup in your repo. Projects created from this template can easily be deployed and shipped. It becomes hassle free and easy to debug too.
